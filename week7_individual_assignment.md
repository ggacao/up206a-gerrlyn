### **Individual Homework - Week 7**

I chose to read Millard-Ball’s et al article on parking search caused congestion, which he terms as congestion due to cruising. This article was really interesting as he used GPS tracing methods to measure the percentage of vehicle trips in Ann Arbor and San Francisco that comprised these excess parking searches (5-6% in some cases but less than 1% of vehicle travel overall). Through this method, they were also able to understand where in the city and in what kind of neighborhoods cruising took place. This article was really interesting as it illustrated the power of GPS tracking and other similar data methods to fill in pre-existing gaps in academic literature used to inform policy. I was most surprised to learn of their conclusion that little cruising took place in SF’s downtown and high-density neighborhoods, especially given the high congestion there. It also pointed to the importance and power that methodology can play in forming a definition for phenomena such as cruising. For instance, Figure 6a and 6b depict tremendous differences in recorded instances of cruising across the city of San Francisco, primarily based on the fact that the former defined cruising as end-trips with an actual travel distance larger than at least 200m than the shortest path (within a 400m radius from the destination) and the former being defined as the mean number of blocks that a car circled repeatedly. Because these can carry a lot of weight in policy recommendations, it reminds me to aim to be very careful and mindful of my own research methodologies and visual representations of my findings.

### *Questions:*

1. How else might you see GPS tracing methods being used to fill gaps in urban planning research in the future? Is there anything you have in mind other than topics that encompass vehicle or transit travel?
2. Can you elaborate more on how you chose a 50% threshold to classify whether trips are labeled as cruising?
