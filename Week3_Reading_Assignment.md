  Reading Boeing's articles made me reflect a lot about the existing gaps in all fields of research, especially in planning. It also reminded me of the data limitations that we have in general, which is one root cause of that. Therefore, with something as core to our cities and built environment as streets, it was both surprising and unsurprising to learn about the realization that Boeing came to: that we had not had a comprehensive understanding of street networks' relationship to variables such as vehicle ownership and topography before his study using OSMnx. It reminded me of other issue areas of planning that face similar issues. For instance, eviction data is so critical to informing advocacy, policy, and planning in the housing justice field. However, that information is under-collected and often inaccurate or incomplete. On top of that, eviction data is not readily public so it can be challenging to attain it in real time, if at all. There are organizations, such as Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, which try to document these cases in urban areas like San Francisco and Los Angeles, but there is not a central hub for this data that can be analyzed on a larger scale. This makes it extremely challenging for researchers, including myself, to conduct accurate and complete data analysis that informs important policy and planning decisions.
  
  With that, I was really impressed to read about Boeing's inclination to develop OSMnx to address such shortcomings in research methodology. Moreso, I really agree with his emphasis on creating a free, open-source program that allows us to analyze global data, which is something I have learned to appreciate since taking this class. Through this program, Boeing was able to create a narrative for US street network design patterns over the last century and prove that griddedness in street networks has a positive relationship with variables such as flatter topography, less vehicle ownership, less greenhouse gas emission, and healthier communities. I think this trajectory in developing new research tools for big data paves a path forward for how we can expand our analysis of, and think more critically about, ongoing planning practices. How can we use these tools to better understand the impact of planning, even the initiatives that are deemed to be more progessive? Overall, these articles invited me to think more about the larger picture for different research topics, and to constantly be active in trying to identify any more gaps or limitations that exist. Given that my research topic for this class is about gentrification and policing in South LA, Boeing's research also made me think about how street development patterns might also be conducive to speeding up displacement of low-income residents or increased policing.
  
**Questions for Boeing:**
  1) We live in a world now overflowing with data on all kinds of variables. However, we also live in a world of increased surveillance and lack of data privacy. As someone whose work benefits from accessible and open-sourced data, what are your thoughts on ethical practices when it comes to protecting residents' privacy?
  2) Do you feel that Python and similar programs will eventually take the place and common practice of Esri's ArcGIS program?
