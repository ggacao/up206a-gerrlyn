Course Description: Welcome to the world of planning and spatial thinking. In recent years, our relationship with maps and map-making has changed dramatically. No longer are we limited to a mode of map-making that is dominated by industry giants like Google and ESRI. Instead, a suite of data-science tools have matured to a point where they can produce similar, if not, more powerful and creative ways that advance spatial exploration. Our understanding of social phenomena through spatial constructs in urban data allows us to address questions on social justice, the environment, transportation, community development and design, amongst many other themes, and how these factors may affect different population groups indifferent ways. This course prepares you for challenges in urban data beyond off-the-shelf cartographic approaches. It looks at the various components of dataʼs journey—acquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization— and how it enables and advances your research from a data science perspective. The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science.
