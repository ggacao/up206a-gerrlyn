### *Profile*: 2nd year MURP student, concentrating in Community Economic Development and Housing. I am originally from Stockton, CA and have a background in public service, community organizing, and policy advocacy. I hope to continue forging a career path towards strategies to make affordable housing more affordable for low-income communities, economic justice, and decommodification of land.
### *Course Description:* The goal for this course is to expose us to the foundations of spatial data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed to human expressions and narratives that are utilized in planning? We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, spatial analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently,through advanced geoprocessing will be introduced. All lessons will be based on “real” data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research. While there are no prerequisites for taking this course, people who are approaching programming for the first time will admittedly find the course to be intense and challenging.
### *Project ideas:* 
I'm still finalizing details and thoughts for my project, but my ideas include: 
1. Researching economic sectors that have been impacted by COVID in City or County of LA 
1. Analyzing potential changes in AMI across the city or county by census tracts between pre-COVID and today. I'd like to then overlay that with the level of unemployment and housing stability within those census tracts as well as a potential reason for such changes (if we have data at that scale) 
### *Objectives for the class:* I would like to gain a base level knowledge for Python and R, which would hopefully strengthen my research skills. I would also like to learn more about how to use open-source mapping programs to expand my knowledge of such programs beyond ESRI. I am completely new to programming and coding, so the language and vocabulary for it is foreign and does not feel intuitive to me.
