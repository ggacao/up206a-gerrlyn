At the Mapathon, I was really excited to be able to attend the QGIS workshop. I have some previous experience using ArcGIS in the past, but have never used QGIS 
before and was not too familiar with it. During the workshop, the facilitator first did an overview of different types of data and provided an overview of how 
data is manipulated for geospatial analysis. Upon getting acquainted with QGIS, she had us download the program as well as a few data sets to explore apartments 
within proximity to certain amenities: public transit, apartment rental prices within a certain budget, and grocery stores near UCLA. With the program, we were 
able to make a buffer around the apartment, count the number of grocery stores within that area, join attributes to a layer, and finally find apartments within 
a given criteria. Overall, I really enjoyed it and was suprised with how much we were able to cover and learn within the timeframe. The workshop also gave me a 
deeper appreciation for open-source data and programs, especially given the fact that I am able to use them on a Mac. I do wish that there was more of a heads up 
with everything we needed to download in order to move forward with the workshop, but felt the facilitator did a great job nonetheless. I gained a new interest 
in wanting to learn the program more, and would like to understand how I might be able to use it for this class and when it might be more advantageous to use 
rather than Python.
